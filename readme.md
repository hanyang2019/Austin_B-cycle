## Background
[Austin Bcycle](https://austin.bcycle.com/) is public bike share system that rolled into Austin in December 2013. The system is owned by the City of Austin and operated by the locl 501(c)(3) non-profit Bike Share of Austin. Austin BCycle immediately broke national records for check outs during SXSW, making it one of the most successful bike-sharing programs in the country. There are currently 75 BCycle stations around downtown Austin, in all the places you want to go!
## Objectives
Explore the data to identify interesting trends. 
1. Build a heat map of multiple layers to visualize bike stations based on popularity from 2014 to 2016.
2. Create an interactive Bar chart to visualize the daily, weekly and monthly utilization of bikes from 2014 to 2016.
3. Make an interactive pie chart to analyze the composition of rider membership from 2014 to 2016.
Results

## Conclusion
1. Austin Bcycle has set up kiosks at strategic location throughout the city, primarily focusing on the downtown and Butler Park areas.
2. Of the membership options offered the 24-hour, which is later described as the Walk-Up option, is by far the most popular, suggesting that most of the users are visitors to the area.
3. The peak checkout times of year are March followed by October. During the month of March, Austin hosts the SXSW Music festival and October is also a busy festival month for the city. As for the most popular day of a week, no big surprise that Friday thru Sunday are the winners for bike checkouts.
